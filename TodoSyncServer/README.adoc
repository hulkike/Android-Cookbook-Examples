== ToDoSyncServer

This project is the backend server for the ToDoList Sync Server. 
It implements in JavaEE (JAX-RS) both a REST service and the web UI parts of the
server.

It needs an app server and a database. Developed with JBoss AS
(now known as WildFly see http://wildfly.org) and PostgreSQL 9. For
JBoss AS/Wildfly setup, see files under wildfly/.
Note: for demo purposes you do NOT need to do this setup.

The JPA model exported by TodoModel is used to save the actual data;
this is the SAME set of classes used in the TodoClient.

For production, the service would need to be configured for BASIC AUTH on the PUT services.

TODO:

* Should provide both its internal form (in JSON presumably) as well
as import/export traditional "todo.txt" format; See http://todotxt.com/
